# smash
A debugger for Linux (and hopefully macOS), written from scratch in Jai.

It’s still in its very early proof-of-concept stage (and might never leave that). But maybe the code is already of use to someone.

## Usage

```
./smash [-work_dir <dir>] [-breakpoint <address>] [--] <program to run + args>
```

Then press `s` for "single instruction step" and `c` for "continue".

There’s not much more yet.
